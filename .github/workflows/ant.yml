          beatoraja with LR2 judge and gauges.
          The download only includes beatoraja.jar.
          You have to download the original beatoraja and replace beatoraja.jar with this jar file.
          We will try to keep LR2oraja releases on this page up-to-date with the latest versions of beatoraja.
